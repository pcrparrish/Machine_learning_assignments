# Machine_learning_assignments

This repository contains my code and associated output reports for machine learning assignments I completed in graduate school. All code is in the `code/` folder and all output reports are in the `docs/` folder. 

To view the output of these assignments in your web browser, please visit the following links: 
* HW1: [Regression, classification, K-nearest neighbors]()
* HW2: [Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, least squares, multiple linear regression]()
* HW3: [Cross-validation, estimating training and test error, lasso and ridge regression]()
* HW4: [Lasso and ridge regression, least squares linear models, regression trees]()
* HW5: [Classification: K-means clustering, support vector machine, maximal margin]()
